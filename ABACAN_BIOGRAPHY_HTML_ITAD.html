                <blockquote>
                    <sup>1</sup>Rafael was born, and was raised in <strong style="color:blue">Taal, Pulilan, Bulacan</strong>. 
                    <sup>2</sup>His birhtday is on <strong>June 14, 2002</strong>.
                    <sup>3</sup>His mother is <strong style="color:blue">Emilia M. Abacan</strong>, and his 
                                    father is <strong style="color:blue">Ramon P. Abacan.</strong> 
                    <sup>4</sup>He has a sister named <strong style="color:blue">Franchesca M. Abacan</strong>. 
                    <sup>5</sup>As a child Rafael dream of becoming a person who works in front of a computer. 
                    <sup>6</sup>He studied at <strong style="color:blue">Saint Bernadette Divine Academy</strong>
                                    during his elementary days. 
                    <sup>7</sup>His hobbies are playing games, playing badminton, and walking outside. 
                    <sup>8</sup>During his Grade 5, he participated in a tournament for badminton which is called bulprisa 
                                    where different school compete with each other. 
                    <sup>9</sup>Rafael lost almost every match except when he was matched with a Grade 2 student. 
                    <sup>10</sup>Still, winning one match give him a place in the tournament, not the best one
                                    but it's very satisfying when he heard it announce in his school.
                    <sup>11</sup>His placing in the tournament was somewhere around 1000 - 3000.
                    <sup>12</sup>Defeat taught him that there is a lot of people that are better than him.
                    <sup>13</sup>Rafael's classmates count on school have not reach two digits when he was Grade 4 - 6.
                    <sup>14</sup>All of the students in his school know each other.
                    <sup>15</sup>There was a day in school where the students have to sleep outside and do some team 
                                    building activities.
                    <sup>16</sup>It was the first time he slept away from his house and could not sleep.
                    <sup>17</sup><em>He learned in that event that there are people who will help you, and there are people 
                                    who will make you sad</em> (A cellphone was stolen during that time, even if students are
                                    not allowed to go to their bags). 
                    <sup>18</sup>Some of the events happened during his childhood days are when he was chased by a goat, 
                                    and when his head was stuck on something.
                    <sup>19</sup>He became aware that life is not all fun but it is beautiful.
                    <sup>20</sup>These memories are precious, and is hard to forget.

                    <sup>4</sup>It was hard for Rafael to adjust since during the elementary days, he only had 8 classmates

                    <sup>5</sup>Rafael joined an art club but got discourage by a single comment from a teacher. 
                    <sup>6</sup>Back then, he did not know how to think flexible.
                    <sup>7</sup>Highschool is not all sad memories.
                    <sup>8</sup>Every day was fun since there are people who can be called friends.
                    <sup>9</sup>Projects may be tough, but it was still fun.
                    <sup>10</sup>There are a lot of events in highschool like foundation day, competitions between 
                                    each sections, and promenade. 
                    <sup>11</sup>Rafael in senior high experienced a lot of things.
                    <sup>12</sup>He enrolled for ICT strand but not a lot of students enrolled in it,
                    <sup>13</sup>He became a <strong style="color:blue">STEM student</strong>.
                    <sup>14</sup>There is an event called senior high school week where seniors shows what they learned 
                                    in the class.
                    <sup>15</sup>It's like foundation day where different grades play, experience what seniors are doing.
                    <sup>16</sup>In that event, Rafael learned to be more cooperative, and a little of leadership.
                    <sup>17</sup>Since there were a lot of things needed to be prepared.

                                course of <strong style="color:blue">Information Technology</strong>.
                    <sup>2</sup>Rafael college time had been rough since it started as online class.

                    <sup>8</sup>College is different from high school.
                    <sup>9</sup>College is harder just from the activities alone.
                    <sup>10</sup>But, Rafael thinks that this is a practice for the future.
                    <sup>11</sup>He must persevere because the life of a person with job may be harder.
                    <sup>12</sup><em>College is a training for the future</em>.

                    <sup>18</sup>To achieve that, he will work harder.
                    <sup>19</sup>At this time, Rafael is also studying how to draw again.
