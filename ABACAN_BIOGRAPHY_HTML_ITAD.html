                    <sup>8</sup>During his Grade 5, he participated in a tournament for badminton which is called bulprisa 
                                    where different school compete with each other. 
                    <sup>9</sup>Rafael lost almost every match except when he was matched with a Grade 2 student.

                                    but it's very satisfying when he heard it announce in his school.
                    <sup>11</sup>His placing in the tournament was somewhere around 1000 - 3000.
                    <sup>12</sup>Defeat taught him that there is a lot of people that are better than him.
                    <sup>13</sup>Rafael's classmates count on school have not reach two digits when he was Grade 4 - 6.
                    <sup>14</sup>All of the students in his school know each other.
                    <sup>15</sup>There was a day in school where the students have to sleep outside and do some team 
                                    building activities.
                    <sup>16</sup>It was the first time he slept away from his house and could not sleep.
                    <sup>17</sup>He learned in that event that <em>there are people who will help you, and there are people 
                                    who will make you sad</em> (A cellphone was stolen during that time, even if students are
                                    not allowed to go to their bags). 
                    <sup>18</sup>Some of the events happened during his childhood days are when he was chased by a goat, 
                                    and when his head was stuck on something.
                    <sup>19</sup>He became aware that life is not all fun but it is beautiful.
                    <sup>20</sup>These memories are precious, and is hard to forget.

                    <sup>13</sup>He became a <strong>STEM student</strong>.

                    <sup>16</sup>In that event, Rafael learned to be more cooperative, and a little of leadership.
                    <sup>17</sup>Since there were a lot of things needed to be prepared.
