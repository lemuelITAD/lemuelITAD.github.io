            <h2 id="Game">1.) Make a Game</h2>
                <p><blockquote>
                    I made my mind to make a game 5 years ago because I think that games last for eternity if it is a good one. It may be a form of 
                    pirated copy when time passes, but people will remember the game no matter how many generation have passed. This is the  kind of game
                    that I want to make.

                <p><blockquote>
                    I want to make animation because I want to create games. These two are related to each other. The animations will be used
                    for the cutscenes in the game. This is to further improve the quality of the game. After finishing the game, I would like to make 
                    a animation version of the game. It is for the people who does not want to play the game or for those people who cannot make up their mind 
                    to play the game.

            <h2 id="Webtoon">3.) Make a Webtoon Series</h2>
                <p><blockquote>
                    For the last 3 years, I've been wanting to create my own series of webtoon and upload it in the site called
                    Webtoon. I practiced to draw because this is one of the things that I wanted to do. The series may not become famous,
                    I just want it to be out there in the world. I also do not mind if the series have a lot of negative remarks. 
                    For this one, I am aiming for at least 20+ chapters.

                <p><blockquote>
                    This one can be to graduate college, or take them to other places. As long as I can do their wishes, and not breaking any laws
                     then I'll gladly do it. As of now I have not done anything for my parents which is why someday I want to fulfill what they want.
