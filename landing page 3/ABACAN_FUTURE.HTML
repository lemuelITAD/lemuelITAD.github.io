            <h2 id="Graduate">1.) Graduate College</h2>
                <p><blockquote>
                    The first thing I want for my future is to graduate from college. It is to have more opportunity
                    to land a job. There are jobs that have a qualifications for the applicant, for example the applicant must
                    know hot to program at a certain degree. There are different ways to study but in paper it is better to finish
                    college.

            <h2 id="Tester">2.) Have a job as an Game Tester</h2>
                <p><blockquote>
                    After college, I want to land a job as a game tester. I believe that with game testing my analization skills
                    will enhance in terms of finding visual errors. In making a game coding is one of the biggest challenges. One kind of
                    error in coding only happens when an event was triggered, and this one is very hard to find. I belive that becoming a game tester
                    will improve my skill in finding this kinds of error. 
                </blockquote></p>

            <h2 id="Game">3.) Make my Own Game</h2>
                <p><blockquote>
                    After obtaining different kinds of skills, I would like to make my own game in the future. This one is what my main goal in life which
                    is why it repeatedly appeared in this website. Coding, Debugging, Animating, and Designing, these things are some examples of 
                    what to expect in game development. Normally it is done by a team that share the workload, which is why I will try to convince my friends
                    to make a game together in the future.
