        <h1>Japan</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The Land of the Rising Sun</p>

        <p class="para">
            famous for natural sights like cherry blossoms and Mount Fuji, cutting-edge technology 
            like Japanese cars and bullet trains, wacky inventions like karaoke and vending machines, 
            cultural values like politeness and punctuality, popular anime and manga, and mouth-watering food
            like ramen and sushi.
            Japan is the place that I like to visit the most one day. The games, and animes that I like were all
            made in japan. I want to see for myself the sceneries, and the technologies of the country. I'm also 
            interested on the dialect of the people that lives in the provinces. One day I would like to hear it in
            person.

        <p class="para">Cherry Blossom bloom in many places in Japan. A flower of many trees of genus Prunus or Prunus subg. Cerasus. 
            They are known as yinghua in Chinese and Japanese cherry and sakura in Japanese. I would like to see it, it does not matter
             where I will see it. I'll gladly gaze at the petals falling down from the tree.</p>

        <p class="para">This place may have some negative impression on some people, but I would still like to go here.
            This is a place where anime, and games merchandise are being sold. Some items can only be found here.

        <h2 style="margin-left: 250px;">Okinawa</h2>
        <p class="para">A prefecture of Japan comprising more than 150 islands in the East China Sea between Taiwan and Japan's mainland. 
            It's known for its tropical climate, broad beaches and coral reefs.
            Okinawa is called the "Hawaii of Japan", the reason why I would like to go to this place is to see
            the beach. If there is a beach, there's nature. I like gazing at natures. It makes me calm and let me feel at ease.
