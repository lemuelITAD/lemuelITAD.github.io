           <p>
            <sup>1</sup>Different people have different kinds of skills.
            <sup>2</sup>For me, I don't possess a lot of skills.
            <sup>3</sup>If I have to say, my skills are <strong>drawing</strong>, 
                            and <strong>thinking the other way around</strong>. 
            <sup>4</sup>Drawing is one of the skill that I really practiced.
            <sup>5</sup>Started from a stickman to a proper drawing.
            <sup>6</sup>I spent a several hours to be good at drawing.
            <sup>7</sup>Up until now, I still practice if I have time.
            <sup>8</sup>There are still a lot things to learn.
            <sup>9</sup>It is very challenging since I'm color blind.
            <sup>10</sup>Still, being color blind won't stop me from improving my drawing skill. 
            <sup>11</sup>Thinking the other way around, the other skill that I said, it means that
                            thinking that is not taking what others said straightly.
            <sup>12</sup>For example, someone said "<em>is this all you've got?</em>", 
            I can take it as negative but it will affect my interest, or morale.
            <sup>13</sup>Instead, I will make what the person said as a positive.
            <sup>14</sup>With that question, I can think that the person expects me to be better, 
                            and he/she wants me to perform better.
            <sup>15</sup>With that, I can avoid being disappointed, and I can continue my 
                            practice.
            <sup>16</sup>I like to think but sometimes it became overthinking.
            <sup>17</sup>I should know when to think a lot, and when not to.
            <sup>18</sup>I may not be a very talented talker, very talented with a lot
                             of things but with perseverance I can finish a job.
            <sup>19</sup><em>I have to work hard to polish my skills</em>.
            <sup>20</sup>I need more experiences to gain more skills and polish it.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup>There are a lot of things that can be done in this world. 
            <sup>2</sup>A little amount of these things are my hobbies.
            <sup>3</sup><strong>watching anime, drawing, playing games, and sleeping</strong>.
            <sup>4</sup>Watching anime can make my mind be at ease.
            <sup>5</sup>It can also make me more creative since I can see a lot of new things.
            <sup>6</sup>It can also make me aware of some events that happen in life since 
                            sometimes it shows different experiences in life.
            <sup>7</sup>It includes the life of an employee, student, and person that goes in a 
                            hardship in life.
            <sup>8</sup>But, overall, I watch anime for entertainment.
            <sup>9</sup>Since pandemic happened, I went back to drawing.
            <sup>10</sup>Until now, I am practicing to become a better artist.
            <sup>11</sup>I started to post my works on Twitter just for fun.
            <sup>12</sup>Nowadays, I usually draw fan arts of the people I'm watching in Youtube.
            <sup>13</sup>It was really satisfying if the person I drew noticed my drawing.
            <sup>14</sup>On my free times, I play games.
            <sup>15</sup>Playing with friends are the one with the most fun.
            <sup>16</sup>Games can be frustrating sometimes, but it's part of the experience.
            <sup>17</sup>After having a tiring day, a sleep will be great.
            <sup>18</sup>It just felt great when sleeping.
            <sup>19</sup>Even if I sleep at any other times.
            <sup>20</sup>These four takes a lot of time in each of my day.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <sup>1</sup>I have a lot of interest in my life.
            <sup>2</sup>Some of it remain, and some of it does not.
            <sup>3</sup>The one that remains are <strong>game development</strong>, and 
                            <strong>animation development</strong>.
            <sup>4</sup>Since my hobbies are playing games, and watching anime, my interest is 
                            almost the same.
            <sup>5</sup>In high school, I tried to study how to develop a game.
            <sup>6</sup>I tried it, and it is hard.
            <sup>7</sup>Hard but very satisfying.
            <sup>8</sup>I have experienced it myself.
            <sup>9</sup>The very own character is moving with keys on my keyboard.
            <sup>10</sup>I did it with the help of the tutorials in Youtube.
            <sup>11</sup>I used Unity for making the game, and C# for Unity.
            <sup>12</sup>I have not finished one yet but I really want too. 
            <sup>13</sup>Now, for the animations, I really admire the animators in anime.
            <sup>14</sup>1 second is made up of 24 frames, it's 24 different drawings.
            <sup>15</sup>I really want to do it because it is related to games like in cutscene.
            <sup>16</sup>The two of my interest is connected to each other.
            <sup>17</sup>I had a dream of making a great game solo.
            <sup>18</sup>A game that will be passed from generations to generations.
            <sup>19</sup>There are a little amount of games today that really leave an impact, 
                            and this became my inspiration.
            <sup>20</sup>I'm studying both game development, and animation on my own in my free
                             time right now, and I hope it will bear fruit someday.
